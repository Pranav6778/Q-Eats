QEats is a popular food ordering app that allows users to browse and order their favorite dishes from nearby restaurants.

During the course of this project,

1. I had build different parts of the QEats backend which is a Spring Boot application.
2. Several REST API endpoints were implemented to query restaurant information and place food orders.
3. To give a sense of real-world problems, production issues were investigated using Scientific Debugging methods.
4. Along with this, I improved the app performance under large load scenarios as well as included an advanced search feature in the app.

Scope of Work
1. Implemented GET /API/v1/restaurants and the corresponding request handler and response methods.
2. Used Mockito to enable the development of the relevant MVCS layers independently.
3. Retrieved a list of restaurants from MongoDB based on a user location.
